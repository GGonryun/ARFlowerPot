# ARFlowerPot

## Usage
This app is my first step into Augmented Reality.

This app uses Vuforia SDK for unity in order to render and display various 3d models and textures. This software requires the use of a developer key which can be obtained from the [Vuforia developer portal](https://developer.vuforia.com/).

The app will render flower pots when it locates a special image, it also has a drop down menu at the top left which allows you to change what you display.
